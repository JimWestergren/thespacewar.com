<h1>Disturbing Sensor</h1>

<p>Disturbing Sensor is a spaceship but does not exist to attack but to disturb the hell out of the opponent.</p>

<h2>Cards Good With This</h2>

<a href="/cards/discovery"><img src="https://images.thespacewar.com/card-42.jpg"></a>

<p>Playing Discovery when you have Disturbing Sensor on the table and forcing the opponent to discard a total of 3 cards after drawing can really affect the game in your favor.</p>

<h2>Rule Clarifications</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The opponent can choose to mill instead of draw in order to only have 1 card in hand after draw phase and thus not having to discard.</li>
    <li>The opponent can continue play missile cards but they can't move or attack as long as the Disturbing Sensor is on the table.</li>
</ul>
