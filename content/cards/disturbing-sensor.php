<p>Playing Discovery when you have Disturbing Sensor on the table and forcing the opponent to discard a total of 3 cards after drawing can really affect the game in your favor.</p>

<h2>Rule Clarifications</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The opponent can continue play missile cards but they can't move or attack as long as the Disturbing Sensor is on the table.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changelog During Playtesting</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Buff in January 2026:<br>The discarding is now an ability and the card being discarded is random. Earlier it was automatically after the opponent's draw phase, they discarded a card if they had more than one card in hand.</li>
    <li>Nerf in April 2019:<br>Reduced defense value from 4 to 3. Now it can more easily be destroyed by for example Hunter.</li>
    <li>September 2018: Created.</li>
</ul>
