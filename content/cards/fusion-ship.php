    <li>Text clarification in March 2023: The previous text was a bit confusing "After first turn instead of move & attack: Replace this and 2 ships in same zone by one spaceship from anywhere." it has now been simplified. But this also mean that the spaceships being fushioned no longer need to be in the same zone which is a buff but it also mean that the new spaceship must enter the home zone and not in the zone where the Fusion Ship was located which is a nerf and a good fix actually for the card. Overall a small nerf.</li>
    <li>Nerf in August 2021: Can no longer use it's fusion ability if it moves.</li>
    <li>September 2019: Created.</li>
