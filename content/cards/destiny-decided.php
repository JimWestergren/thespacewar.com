<h1>Destiny Decided</h1>

<p>Destiny Decided is a great card to play when you have more cards on the table than the opponent and you are planning to win in 1-2 turns. You will use your spaceships/missiles to win the game and don't really need to play any more cards in order to win.</p>

<p>It will seriously slow down the opponent in the end game when you normally play perhaps 4 cards per turn.</p>
