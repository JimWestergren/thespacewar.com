<h2>Rule Clarifications</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Duration cards that has no effect still has to be paid for or discarded as normal.</li>
    <li>The newest duration card that enters the game overwrites the rule of any conflicting duration card on the table. (for example when both players have played <a href='/cards/neutralization'>Neutralization</a> then only the latest one has the ability "Remove from play to destroy another duration card.")</li>
</ul>
