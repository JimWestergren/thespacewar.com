<p>Trigger-Happy Joe is a card that can be good in some situations, for example to destroy 2 different targets in a single turn. Together with Full Attack it becomes a truly great card doing 2 + 2 damage in a single turn.</p>

<h2>Design Notes From Jim</h2>

<p>Part of the initial list of cards created in the summer of 2018. Never changed.</p>

<p>Without Full Attack it is kind of weak card but it is a strong card when playing versus The Swarm considering the huge amount of Drones.</p>

<p>Is having 3 of those + 3 Full Attack too good in a constructed deck? No, it is not fast enough to be considered a problem.</p>
