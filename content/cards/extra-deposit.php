<ul>
    <li>Buff in January 2026:<br>This line was removed: "In your action phase you may look at and take to your hand bottom row station cards." and this line added "Your opponent can’t force you to discard cards."</li>
    <li>Reworked in December 2025: Earlier version of this card was a duration that cost 1: "You have no maxium hand size. During your action phase you may look at and put any of your third row station cards to your hand". That card was deleted and the current new text of the card comes from the old card "Over Capacity" which is now reworked to a new card with the name "Corrupted Outpost".</li>
