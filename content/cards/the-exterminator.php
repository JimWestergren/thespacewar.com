<p>The Exterminator is the second biggest spaceship in the game. It is slow but only cost 5 to play.</p>

<h2>Cards Good Against This</h2>

<?=cardImage('nuclear-missile')?>
<?=cardImage('fatal-error')?>
<?=cardImage('emp-missile')?>
<?=cardImage('target-missed')?>
<?=cardImage('supernova')?>

<p>All those 5 cards are really bad against The Exterminator, especially the first 2 which completely destroys it.</p>

<h2>Cards Good With This</h2>

<?=cardImage('luck')?>
<?=cardImage('destiny-decided')?>
<?=cardImage('disturbing-sensor')?>
<?=cardImage('big-repair-ship')?>
<?=cardImage('small-repair-ship')?>

<p>Luck is really crucial in order to counter basically all good cards against this. Destiny Decided also blocks Supernova. The repair ships is not only for reactivating from an EMP attack but also for repairing damage taken.</p>
