<h2>Cards Good Against This</h2>

<a href="/cards/fatal-error"><img src="https://images.thespacewar.com/card-38.jpg"></a>

<a href="/cards/supernova"><img src="https://images.thespacewar.com/card-15.jpg"></a>

<p>All those 5 cards are really bad against The Exterminator, especially the first 2 which completely destroys it.</p>

<h2>Cards Good With This</h2>

<a href="/cards/small-repair-ship"><img src="https://images.thespacewar.com/card-29.jpg"></a>

<p>Luck is really crucial in order to counter basically all good cards against this. Destiny Decided also blocks Supernova. The repair ships is not only for reactivating from an EMP attack but also for repairing damage taken.</p>
