<p>Small Repair Ship is really a great card, especially because it can move the first turn and repair a big spaceship that has previously been targeted by EMP Missile making it possible for that to attack in the same turn.</p>

<p>Keep in mind however that with a low cost of 2 actions it is a popular card being countered with luck.</p>
