<h2>Design Notes From Jim</h2>

<p>Part of the initial list of cards created in the summer of 2018. Never changed. Had originally 2 in The Terrans deck but it was considered too strong so 1 copy was removed.</p>

<p>Is having 3 of those too good in a constructed deck? No, it does not seem so considering all the good shields and easy way to stop missiles.</p>
