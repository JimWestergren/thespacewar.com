<h1>Nuclear Missile</h1>

<p>Excellent against big spaceships. Can of course also be used aggressively but tends to get destroyed before being able to hit the opponents station and winning the game, but in any case good to put extra pressure in your attack.</p>

<h2>Meaning of "Damage goes through shield"</h2>

<p>It means that if you have the Nuclear Missile in the enemy zone and attack a shield with for example 4 life remaining it will mean that the shield gets destroyed and the 6 remaining damage will be dealt to the enemy station.</p>

<h2>Suggested rule</h2>

<p>I have been considering to add the following rule to this card but have not done so in order to not make the game more complicated:<br>
"If destroyed deals 1 damage to all targets in the same zone."</p>
