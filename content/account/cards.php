<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>If you are a good regular player and have some luck you will probably be able to earn a good chunk of money.</p>

<h3>What About Rarity of Cards?</h3>
<p>With "random card" is meant the same as if you would mix all the cards of the preset decks together and pick 1 card at random. Meaning that for example there is a higher chance to receive Drone (15 copies) than for example Titan (1 copy). The mixing is reset for each card you buy, even if you buy several the same time.</p>
